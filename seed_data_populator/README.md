This is a simple python script to get seed data from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) which provides a free api for cocktail recipes.

I have compiled a list of top 50 cocktails from various websites, before finding the corresponding recipes from the cocktail db site.
With the raw data, I transformed it into the seed data format I need.
